# KP5 Academy - PostgreSQL Architecture Implementation Summary

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decision: PostgreSQL + Node.js Backend

**DECISION**: Use **PostgreSQL** as the primary database with **Node.js/Express** backend instead of Firebase.

### Why PostgreSQL?
- **Relational Data**: Sports management has complex relational data (users, teams, matches, statistics)
- **ACID Compliance**: Critical for financial transactions and match data integrity
- **Scalability**: Better for complex queries and reporting
- **Cost Effective**: No per-request pricing model
- **Full Control**: Complete ownership of data and infrastructure

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (Updated)

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma
- **Authentication**: JWT + bcrypt
- **Validation**: Express-validator + Zod
- **File Upload**: Multer + Sharp
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Email**: Nodemailer
- **Logging**: Winston
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose

### Web App
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling**: Bootstrap + Tailwind CSS
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Query + Zustand
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control

### Mobile App
- **Framework**: React Native + Expo
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **State Management**: React Query + Zustand
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control

## üîÑ Migration Status
